#### Attention Agent:

#### Your team is trapped inside a facility. To rescue them, you need to crack the network password within 5 attempts. Time is running out as toxins are building up throughout the facility.

#### Don't worry, you have a special program that can analyze your guesses based on network response times. It will tell you if you're on the right track.

#### Good luck, Agent!
